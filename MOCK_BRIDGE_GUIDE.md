# Mock Bridge for Browser Testing

## ✅ **Solution: You're Testing in Browser, Not SuperApp**

The error happened because:
- ❌ `AppNativeJsBridge: false` (not in SuperApp)
- ❌ SDK can't work without the native bridge
- ✅ This is **EXPECTED** in a regular browser

---

## 🧪 **Mock Bridge Now Added**

I've added a **mock bridge** so you can test in the browser during development!

### **What It Does:**
1. ✅ Simulates `AppNativeJsBridge` in browser
2. ✅ Mocks payment responses
3. ✅ Updates user agent to include "Customer"
4. ✅ Allows testing the full flow without SuperApp
5. ⚠️ Returns fake/mock data (not real payments)

---

## 🚀 **How to Use:**

### **Step 1: Restart Dev Server**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Hard Refresh Browser**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### **Step 3: Check Console**

You should now see:
```
🧪 MOCK MODE: Injecting mock AppNativeJsBridge for browser testing
⚠️ This is a MOCK bridge - not real SuperApp!
✅ Mock bridge injected
✅ User agent updated to include "Customer"
🧪 You can now test payment flows in the browser
```

### **Step 4: Check SDK Status**

Run in console:
```javascript
console.log('AppNativeJsBridge:', !!window.AppNativeJsBridge);
console.log('window.payment:', !!window.payment);
console.log('User Agent:', navigator.userAgent);
```

Should show:
```
AppNativeJsBridge: true  ✅
window.payment: true  ✅
User Agent: ... Customer  ✅
```

### **Step 5: Try Payment**

Now when you click "Pay Now":
- ✅ Will use mock bridge
- ✅ Will show success after 500ms delay
- ✅ You'll see mock transaction ID
- ⚠️ **NOT a real payment!**

---

## 📊 **What You'll See:**

### **In Console When Payment Runs:**
```
🚀 Starting payment process
📝 Step 1: Preparing payment...
✅ Payment prepared
💳 Payment params: {...}
🏪 Step 2: Opening cashier...
🔍 Checking payment API availability...
  window.payment exists: true
  window.payment.payOrder exists: true
  AppNativeJsBridge exists: true
🎯 Using window.payment.payOrder
📤 Mock Bridge Received: {api: "payOrder", ...}
💳 Mock Payment Order: {...}
📥 Mock Bridge Responding: {code: "0", data: {...}}
✅ Cashier opened successfully
```

### **Mock Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "transactionId": "mock_txn_1234567890",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "Mock payment successful"
}
```

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Production Setup**

### **Before Deploying to Production:**

**REMOVE the mock bridge from index.html:**

```html
<!-- DELETE THESE LINES IN PRODUCTION -->
<script src="/mock-bridge.js"></script>
```

### **Why?**
- Mock bridge should ONLY be used for development
- In production, the real SuperApp will inject the real bridge
- Mock bridge will detect real bridge and not interfere

---

## 🔄 **Two Modes:**

### **Development (Browser Testing):**
```
Mock Bridge → SDK → Your App
✅ Test the full flow
⚠️ Mock data only
```

### **Production (Real SuperApp):**
```
Real SuperApp Bridge → SDK → Your App
✅ Real payments
✅ Real transaction IDs
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist:**

After restarting:

- [ ] See "MOCK MODE" message in console
- [ ] `AppNativeJsBridge` exists (true)
- [ ] `window.payment` exists (true)
- [ ] User agent includes "Customer"
- [ ] Try payment - should complete successfully
- [ ] See mock transaction ID
- [ ] Check debug panel - should show all green

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Restart dev server** (npm run dev)
2. **Hard refresh** browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Check console** for "MOCK MODE" message
4. **Try payment** - should work now with mock data
5. **When ready for real testing** - deploy to SuperApp and remove mock-bridge.js

## 💡 **Understanding the Flow:**

### **In Browser (with mock):**
```
User clicks Pay
  ↓
Your React app calls window.payment.payOrder()
  ↓
SDK calls AppNativeJsBridge.postMessage()
  ↓
Mock bridge simulates response
  ↓
SDK receives mock data
  ↓
Your app shows success
```

### **In Real SuperApp:**
```
User clicks Pay
  ↓
Your React app calls window.payment.payOrder()
  ↓
SDK calls AppNativeJsBridge.postMessage()
  ↓
Native app shows real cashier
  ↓
User completes payment
  ↓
Native app returns real result
  ↓
SDK receives real data
  ↓
Your app shows success
```

---

**Now restart your dev server and try the payment again! It should work with mock data!** 🚀
